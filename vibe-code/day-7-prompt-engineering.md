  Key Takeaways from the HumanLayer Blog Post:
  1. LLMs are stateless - CLAUDE.md is the primary onboarding mechanism
  2. Less is more - Keep under 300 lines (ideally ~60 lines); Claude reliably follows 150-200 instructions max
  3. Three-part framework: WHAT (structure), WHY (purpose), HOW (workflows)
  4. Progressive disclosure - Reference docs rather than embed everything
  5. Don't use Claude as a linter - Remove style instructions; use deterministic tools
  6. Only universally applicable guidance - Avoid task-specific content
