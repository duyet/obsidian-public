## How This Works

This site is a "vibe post" workflow - content written by LLM to summary with predefined slash commands and hooks to manage itself.

### The Process

```
/tldr summary this post <link> into <category>
```

1. **Create**: The [`/tldr`](/claude-code/slash-commands/#example-1-tldr---summary-post-writer) command summarizes the content and creates a new post, refined through follow-up prompts
2. **Index**: [Claude Code hooks](/claude-code/hooks) automatically update the README index when files change
3. **Commit**: Trigger [`/git-commit-push`](/claude-code/slash-commands#example-2-git-commit-push---commit-and-push-workflow) or let [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) auto-sync
4. **Deploy**: [GitHub Actions](/tutorials/github-actions-sync-obsidian-repos) syncs from private repo to [public repo](https://github.com/duyet/obsidian-public) and deploys to [duyet.github.io/obsidian-public](http://duyet.github.io/obsidian-public "http://duyet.github.io/obsidian-public")
