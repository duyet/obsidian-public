## The Prompt

```
Hand-drawn style fashion concept breakdown diagram.

Center: A full-body shot of a stylish, confident, slightly sexy (but not
explicit) female character, with a natural and energetic pose.

Surrounding: Structured layout of her key elements:

• Clothing layers—showing coat, underwear, leggings (lace, tulle material),
  shapewear, and zooming in on detail patterns.

• Expression sheet—3-4 facial expressions (neutral, shy, surprised, focused).

• Close-up shots—fabric fold textures, skin details, hand gestures.

• Lifestyle and accessories—opened handbag containing daily items: lipstick,
  perfume, compact powder, hand cream, diary, health supplements.

• Material annotations—handwritten style notes next to each item (e.g.,
  "soft lace", "matte leather", "shade #520").

Background: Soft beige or parchment texture, creating a design sketch
atmosphere.

Lighting: Clean and soft shadows, making the image integrated.

Output: 4K HD 2D illustration, combining sexiness and fashion sense.

Language: Chinese and English labels.
