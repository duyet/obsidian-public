## The Prompt

```
Convert a simple flat vector logo into a soft, fluffy 3D object. Use original
colors. The object is completely covered in fur, with hyper-realistic fur
texture and soft shadows. It is located in the center of a clean light gray
background, floating gently in the air. The style is surreal, tactile and
modern, creating a comfortable and playful feeling. Use studio lighting and
high-resolution rendering.
```
