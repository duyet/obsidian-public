## The Prompt

```
[A hand-drawn infographic sketch on cream-colored sketchbook paper showing
comparative statistics between different countries. The chart features
national flags drawn with ink pens and colored pencils integrated into the
visualization. All elements are sketched by hand: bars, lines, numbers, and
country names written in casual handwritten font style. Colors are filled in
with cross-hatching, parallel lines, and pen strokes rather than solid
watercolor - creating a textured, sketchy appearance. Each data point shows
precise numerical values written by hand. The chart compares an interesting
statistic across 8-12 countries (like tea consumption per capita, smartphone
ownership, urban population percentage, bicycle usage, book reading hours,
or other fascinating metrics). Clean but clearly hand-drawn grid lines,
artistic pen work with visible strokes and texture, natural imperfections
that make it feel authentic. The aesthetic is like a designer's working
notebook - professional data visualization meets casual sketchbook artistry.
Paper texture visible, slight shadows, organic and warm feel.]
